# ComfyUI-docker

A containerization of the official ComfyUI diffusion model GUI. Includes ComfyUI-Manager.

## Goal

Originally, an attempt to containerize ComfyUI for deployment on a homelab and integration with an Open WebUI instance.

## Usage

1. Use the `install_ComfyUI.sh` or `install_ComfyUI.bat` (Windows) script to clone the repositories and install ComfyUI-Manager.
2. Build the Docker image by running `docker build -t comfyui .` in the root directory of this repository.
3. Run `docker compose up -d` to start the container.
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8188` to access the GUI.

## Known Issues

- Some more directories and files should probably be ignored during build.
